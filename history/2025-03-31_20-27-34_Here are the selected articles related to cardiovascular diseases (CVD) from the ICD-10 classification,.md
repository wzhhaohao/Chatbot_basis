---

### **201. The triggering of myocardial infarction by fine particles is enhanced when particles are enriched in secondary species**  
- **Methods**: Case-crossover study of 1,563 transmural myocardial infarction (MI) cases in New Jersey (2004–2006). PM2.5 species concentrations were modeled and linked to health data.  
- **Results**: Higher odds of MI were observed on days with elevated sulfate (OR = 1.13), nitrate (OR = 1.18), and ammonium mass fractions, and lower elemental carbon (OR = 1.17). Secondary PM2.5 components (e.g., sulfates) were most strongly associated with acute MI risk.

### **203. Air particulate matter and cardiovascular disease: a narrative review**  
- **Methods**: Review of epidemiological and experimental studies on PM2.5 and CVD.  
- **Results**: PM2.5 exposure is linked to myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. Susceptible groups (e.g., elderly, diabetics) show heightened risks. Multi-pollutant approaches are needed due to complex interactions.

### **204. Synergy between particles and nitrogen dioxide on emergency hospital admissions for cardiac diseases in Hong Kong**  
- **Methods**: Time-series analysis (1998–2007) of emergency cardiac admissions and air pollution (PM10, NO2).  
- **Results**: Strongest joint effects when PM10 and NO2 were both high. A 10 μg/m³ increase in PM10 and NO2 increased admissions by 0.55% and 1.20%, respectively, when the other pollutant was elevated.  

---

### **208. Joint effects of job strain and road-traffic and occupational noise on myocardial infarction**  
- **Methods**: Case-control study in Stockholm (1992–1994) with 1,252 MI cases and 1,798 controls. Exposure to noise and job strain was assessed.  
- **Results**: Combined exposure to noise and job strain increased MI risk (OR = 2.27 for all three factors). Noise alone (OR = 1.23) and job strain (OR = 1.39) also showed independent effects.  

---

### **212. Ambient air pollutants and acute case-fatality of cerebro-cardiovascular events: Takashima Stroke and AMI Registry, Japan (1988–2004)**  
- **Methods**: Case-crossover analysis of stroke and acute MI mortality in Japan. Pollutants included PM, SO2, NO2, and ozone.  
- **Results**: NO2 was associated with increased stroke case-fatality (OR = 1.65 for highest quartile). No significant associations for other pollutants.  

---

### **213. Environmental pollutants and stroke-related hospital admissions**  
- **Methods**: Time-series analysis in São José dos Campos, Brazil (2007–2008), linking PM10 to stroke admissions.  
- **Results**: A 10 μg/m³ increase in PM10 raised stroke hospitalization risk by 12% (RR = 1.137).  

---

### **222. Do current levels of air pollution kill? The impact of air pollution on population mortality in England**  
- **Methods**: Panel study (1998–2005) analyzing PM10, NO2, CO, and ozone associations with CVD mortality.  
- **Results**: PM10 and ozone were significantly associated with increased mortality. Effect sizes were larger than previously estimated, with no safe threshold.  

---

### **228. Ozone modifies associations between temperature and cardiovascular mortality: analysis of the NMMAPS data**  
- **Methods**: Multi-city time-series study (1987–2000) examining ozone-temperature interactions.  
- **Results**: Ozone amplified temperature-related CVD mortality, especially in summer. A 10°C temperature rise with high ozone increased mortality by 8.31%.  

---

### **230. Associations of fine and ultrafine particulate air pollution with stroke mortality in an area of low air pollution levels**  
- **Methods**: Time-series analysis in Helsinki (1998–2004) of PM2.5, ultrafine particles, and stroke mortality.  
- **Results**: PM2.5 and ultrafine particles were linked to stroke mortality in warm seasons (7.4% and 8.5% increases per interquartile range).  

---

### **234. A new model for investigating the mortality effects of multiple air pollutants in air pollution mortality time-series studies**  
- **Methods**: Proposed model to disentangle effects of correlated pollutants (PM10, CO, NO2, SO2) using time-series data.  
- **Results**: Improved precision in estimating pollutant-specific effects, revealing independent contributions of PM10 and gases.  

---

### **242. Air pollution and daily mortality in three U.S. counties**  
- **Methods**: Generalized additive models for PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and ozone in Cook, Los Angeles, and Maricopa counties (1987–1995).  
- **Results**: Gases (especially CO) showed stronger associations with CVD mortality than PM. Regional heterogeneity was notable.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**:  
1. **PM2.5 and Secondary Species**: Strong links to MI and stroke, especially sulfates/nitrates.  
2. **Multi-Pollutant Synergy**: PM10 + NO2 or ozone exacerbates CVD risks.  
3. **Vulnerable Groups**: Elderly and those with pre-existing conditions are at higher risk.  
4. **No Safe Threshold**: Even low-level pollution increases CVD mortality.
